<p class="lead unify">&mdash;Touch India President</p>

<p class="lead unify">This simply means, we must pray.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="span8 unify">
<p>We must pray for the nation of India, deceived by idolatrous Hinduism, where people believe in, pray to, and worship millions of gods&hellip; where cows are sacred and kids are abandoned, starving of malnutrition and dying of disease&hellip; where the outcastes, the &ldquo;untouchables,&rdquo; living in slums are not even considered to have equality with human beings&hellip; where parents maim children and beggars buy babies to attract more sympathy of the passerby&hellip; where there is a handful of the rich that lack compassion and there are countless poor that lack basic necessities&hellip; where our brothers and sisters in Christ are beaten, killed, imprisoned, or falsely accused for telling people the truth about Jesus Christ&hellip; It is for this nation we must fight, bringing our knees to war. We must pray&hellip;</p>

<p>We must pray for state of Karnataka, India, where God, in a society that considers widows to be bad omens, took <span class="green">one widow</span>, and used her to start Touch India Ministries&hellip; where God, told this <span class="green">outcaste widow</span> to take care of His precious deprived children, and it has grown into a children&rsquo;s home that cares for, feeds, and loves hundreds of needy children&hellip; where God, gave this <span class="green">ordinary widow</span> a vision to reach her nation through education, and it has grown to an English Christian school providing thousands of students the opportunity to receive a good education while hearing about the love and truth of Jesus&hellip; where God, uses this <span class="green">unlikely widow</span> to proclaim to other widows and to those that are sick the truth&mdash;that they are loved and are important and that they matter to God, their Creator&hellip; where God, uses this <span class="green">one widow</span> to organize pastor training seminars, encouraging the faithful, persecuted followers all across India that they are not alone and Jesus is worth everything&mdash;no matter the cost&hellip; It is this ministry that we can support by bringing our knees to war. We must pray.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The <span class="green">Knees 2 War</span> 5K &amp; 1mile Walk/Run</span> events give people the opportunity to literally use their knees and &ldquo;bring them to war&rdquo; by walking or running for the nation of India.

Proceeds from these events will build a new children&#39;s home and finishing the top floor of the school building.</p>

<div class="span6 unify">
<p class="lead green">Children&#39;s Home Ministry</p>

<p>At present, there are 123 children living in the Thomas Children&rsquo;s Home for the Needy. Some are orphans, others are from homes that cannot afford to meet their needs, and about 40% are pastors&rsquo; children from areas where they are persecuted for their faith in Jesus. In the home, the children are supplied with food, clothing, shelter, Christian love and guidance, and an education they would otherwise not be able to receive. The monthly cost for one child to stay in the home is $120, which is obtained from supporters of the ministry.</p>

<p>The property for the Thomas Children&rsquo;s Home for the Needy is being leased, and the owner has indicated a desire to eventually sell the land. Because of this, Touch India Ministries is raising funds to build their own children&rsquo;s home that can house 200 children. Proceeds from the Knees 2 War events support this building effort.</p>

<p class="lead green">School Ministry</p>

<p>Currently, Touch India Ministries owns and operates the Thomas Memorial English School, offering an education for students from Pre-K to 10th grade. The school is located near Bangalore, India, and can hold up to 1,000 students. It is a Christian school and provides students with a much desired English education. Plans are to complete the school building by adding a fourth floor to house a two-year university prep school. Proceeds from the Knees 2 War events support this building effort.</p>
</div>
<!--/.span6 -->

<div class="span6 unify">
<p class="lead green">Pastors Ministry</p>

<p>About 1600 pastors in the state of Karnataka are associated directly or indirectly with Touch India Ministries. Biblical training is provided for these pastors through seminars conducted by volunteer pastors from the USA. Supporters of the ministry also donate funds to supplement the pastors in areas where there is a need. Plans are to use part of the fourth floor of the school building for biblical training which will enable certificates to be issued to the pastors. This is a requirement by the government to be recognized as a legitimate pastor.</p>

<p class="lead green">Widows Ministry</p>

<p>In India, there are thousands of widows, and the culture places little value on their lives. Many live on the streets and in dire poverty. A special ministry is to gift them with sarees, typical Indian dresses. Each year, Touch India Ministries is able to distribute hundreds of sarees as well as give them the message of hope and truth found only in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="lead green">HIV Patient Ministry</p>

<p>HIV patients are put in AIDS colonies, and virtually left to die. Touch India Ministries encourages churches to support local pastors in these areas so they are able to reach out to the needs of these hurting people. While many neglect these precious souls, they are loved and hear the gospel message by these pastors.</p>
